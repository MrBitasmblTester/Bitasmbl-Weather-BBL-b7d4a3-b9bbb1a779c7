# Bitasmbl-Weather-BBL-b7d4a3-b9bbb1a779c7

## Description
Build a web application that displays current weather, multi-day forecasts, and visualizes trends with charts. The project focuses on integrating APIs, dynamic front-end updates, and data visualization for an interactive user experience.

## Tech Stack
- Java
- Express.js
- React

## Requirements
- Fetch real-time weather data from a public API
- Display multi-day weather forecasts with clear UI elements
- Visualize temperature, humidity, or other metrics with charts
- Support user interactions, such as searching by city
- Optionally cache API responses to improve performance

## Installation
bash
git clone https://github.com/MrBitasmblTester/Bitasmbl-Weather-BBL-b7d4a3-b9bbb1a779c7.git
cd Bitasmbl-Weather-BBL-b7d4a3-b9bbb1a779c7


## Usage
- Run Java backend as configured
- Run Express.js server as configured
- Start React app and open in browser

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up Java backend for core logic as needed.
2. Initialize Express.js server for weather API integration and optional caching.
3. Create React app for UI, search by city, and dynamic updates.
4. Implement components for current weather and multi-day forecasts.
5. Add chart components to visualize temperature, humidity, or other metrics.
6. Connect React to Express.js and Java layers as designed.
7. Test user interactions and data visualization.

## API Endpoints
- Express.js routes to fetch weather data from a public API and return to React UI.
